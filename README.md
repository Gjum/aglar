aglar
=====

Standalone OpenGL [agar.io](http://agar.io/) Python client using [pyglet](https://pyglet.readthedocs.org/) and [agarnet](https://github.com/Gjum/agarnet/).

This is a work in progress. You can already play, but expect bugs, changes, and the unexpected.

Usage
-----

This will change. I plan on releasing this on pip.

	pip3 install pyglet agarnet
	git clone https://github.com/Gjum/aglar.git
	cd aglar
	python3 gl.py

Have fun!

Disclaimer
----------

This project isn't affiliated with agar.io in any way. When playing with this client, you do not get advertisements, which may be nice for you, but does not pay for the servers needed to run the game.
